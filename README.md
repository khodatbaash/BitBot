This is a trader Bot for Bitcoin.
It uses your Binance wallet to trade, you don't need to give the code any credentials of your account, just an API key that Binance generates will suffice for the program to operate on you account. so it's completely safe.
If you have a server you can easily run it trade for you, only you need some parameters justification based on your risk level, and expectations.
Otherwise you can reach out me, I might be able to help you with that.
